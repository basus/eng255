## Sense memory tracking experiment

the smell of coming home

being woken up in the morning

the taste of a prawn mayo sandwich

seeing my elementary school for the first time

eating pizza on the couch

rain on a hot day

cold shower after coming back from school

milk and cereal for breakfast

fish and chips in Dublin

falling down on the grass

seeing a non-english movie for the first time

eating gummy bears

drinking hot black coffee

typing on a keyboard

writing with a fountain pen

standing in front of the library at 2am

watching the sun rise

learning to dance the waltz

actually dancing the waltz

real Italian pizza

drinking lemon iced tea

signing a check

eating potato chips

standing on a high balcony

scraping my knee

learning to ride a bike

seeing the Lafayette campus for the first time

walking up and down the stairs to Easton and back

getting wet in the rain

saturday morning cartoons

reading a comic book

getting woken up to see the Eiffel tower

eating marshmallows

watching a football game

watching a baseball game

trying to write a story

solving a math problem

throwing a ball

sleeping on a plane

running in a race

walking on wet grass

walking the streets of an unfamiliar city

learning to drive

riding a horse

the first day of school

slipping on ice

eating spicy food and crying as a result

choking on car exhaust

falling in the mud

watching lightning and hearing thunder

falling asleep on a cold night

watching the Star Wars movies

catching and throwing a frisbee

getting shampoo in my eyes

running out of ink during a test

almost losing my eye

almost getting lost in Long Island

being in a car crash

lighting fireworks

getting vaccination shots

running a fever

drinking a flaming triple shot in a Mexican restaurant in Virginia in 10 seconds

climbing onto the roof of a 7 storey building

forgetting my homework

cheating on a test
