Some lines are deep, showing the inner complexities. Others seem like mere scratches which will go away in a day or two. I turn it over and it's more of the same, only darker this time, The nails are solid, but they seem thin. I remember trimming them a few days ago. I wonder what a wild hand looks like. I look at the bending fingers. they want to stay curved, not straight. There hands were meant to grasp tools, not to be clasped in prayer. Talking about tools I realized that the most I do with this hand is type, since it's my left hand. With all the hundreds of key presses, you'd think that the tips would be blunt, or maybe bruised. But they seem to show no signs of all the presses that they've gone through. I also realized that I've gotten used to typing at high speeds and when I'm stuck writing at low speeds, my brain is busy buffering and sequencing and it's screaming at me to get a move on.
