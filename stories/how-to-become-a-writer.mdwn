In order to learn how to become a writer first learn how to frickin' TYPE. And I don't mean how to hunt and peck and finally find the key you were looking for five minutes after how started looking for it. I mean learn to really type, so that you can spit out a hundred words without breaking a sweat (or your fingers for that matter). Your brain comes up with ideas at the speed of lightning (literally) and if your fingers can't keep up then you're going to end up missing most of those ideas (some of which might be your best). So learn to type. Please. Now. And when you're done come back and read the rest of this.

Done? Good. Now that you know how to type, it's time to figure out *what* to type. As hard as it is to learn how to type fast, it's not going to come to much if what you type is complete and utter garbage. Not to discourage you or anything, I'm just saying that what you'll start off writing is going to be pretty darn bad. But that's ok, you already knew that and that's why you're reading this, right?

Anyways getting back to how to become a writer. Well, truth be told, I haven't quite figured out that part yet. Don't worry I have the rest of it all figured out. The whole publish, sell, profit, retire to Silicon Valley (don't ask), I have that all down. It's the writing part that's turning out to be a bitch. I'm making progress of course, which is self-evident from the fact that I am actually writing this. So here's what I've got so far. By the way, in the spirit of 21st century online collaboration, which resembles a million monkeys typing on a million typewriters (aka bloggers) I'm putting this online so that you can freely add your own ideas and thoughts to it and make it a testament to this wisdom of crowds.

Idea number 1: Read. A lot. And then read some more. Most importantly, don't just read what you want to write. By all means read most of what you eventually see yourself writing, study it in fact, but don't limit yourself to that. There's a reason that English majors study all sorts of literature even if they eventually want to become just playwrights or just novelists. The more ideas you have swimming in your head, the better you will be at coming up with interesting ones of your own.

Talking about English majors, that's tip number 2: don't be one. It's my theory that English majors make the worst writers. Just think about it: Mark Twain was a steamboat pilot-in-training. Isaac Asimov was a professional chemist. As for Shakespeare they didn't even have English majors in those days, so he certainly doesn't count. Try an interesting major, like engineering, chemistry or applied mathematics. If you must be an English major, make sure it's for some higher purpose (such as there's a really cute girl in your Creative Writing class, but you're simply too shy to actually talk to her). And even then, at least attach yourself to some sort of self-destructive socially-frowned-upon bad habit. I've found alcohol, drugs, schizophrenia and recurring suicide attempts to be the most productive.

Tip 3 is probably the hardest. Are you ready for it? Sure? Okay here goes, take a deep breath. What you need to do to really be a writer is to *write* (or in our case, type).
