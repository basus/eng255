\begin{verse}

 My life is an open book,\\
 Each page is a memory,\\
 Every line a thought.  


 There are the times I fell off a bike\\
 And skinned my knees.\\
 The times I came home after a long vacation\\
 To the strange smell of a familiar space.  


 I have walked on grass and slipped on ice.\\
 I left school, friends and family, just to start over.\\
 I've walked down Dublin's streets, when I should have been asleep\\
 And I've been asleep in Paris when I should have been awake.  


 I've traveled across the world\\
 More times than I care to count.\\
 For each flight, my flapping wings turn a new page.\\
 My life is an open book, mostly unwritten.\\
 I make a line for every hour,\\
 A dot for every minute.\\
 Long live pen on paper, scratch on stone.\\
 Longer than blood and mortal bone.
