My life is my message
A continuous telegraph with no stops.
Sometimes a drama, sometimes action
Mostly a comedy.

Each day is a haiku
Short and to the point.
Each week is a sonnet
Even in rhythm and rhyme.
Each month a limerick
Funny and sharp.

My life is my message
And I have something to say.
But I don't know what
And it's not time yet.
But stay tuned,
All the life's a stage
And I plan on a starring role.
