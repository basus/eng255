# I'm lying

I dedicate this tuneless track.

I'm lying.

My tracks are my sweat, my tears and blood

They've cost me dear, but I have no regret,.

I am no goose laying golden eggs.

I do not give things, only to have them taken.

My work I dedicate, but not to you.

My work I dedicate, but only to me.

The thousands of me, across time, acrosss space

To the ones who toil on their own tracks,

Though they be tuneless and mute.

To those whose hearts beat and spring for rhyme

With power like a tornado in its prime,

To them I dedicate.



Oh no, you don't!

Steal and call it sell,

Restrict and call it free,

Destroy and call it create,

You, who know no tools use,

Save you wallets might.

Oh no, you don't!

Put words in our mouths,

Give us bills instead of praise,

Give us guts instead of glory,

Take our meat and hand us stale buns.

Oh no, you don't!



Farewell, you lords of carrion!

From your stone walls I flee,

From your pens of plunder I secede.

I dedicate this tuneless track, but not to you!
