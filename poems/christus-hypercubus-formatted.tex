\begin{verse}
Shape of the Fourth Dimension\\
\hspace{3em}Descended to the Third.\\
Son of a Higher Plane,\\
\hspace{3em}Born on a Lower.

\begin{center}
God, inconceivable, intractable,\\
Beyond the Mind of Man.\\
Born in human form,\\
Died of human hate.
\end{center}


\begin{flushright}
Hypercube, unimaginable, unpaintable,\\ 
Only in symbols given shape.\\ 
Unraveled in three dimensions,\\ 
A mere shadow of the glory in four.
\end{flushright}

\begin{flushright}
Christ Jesus, with whose flesh and blood\\
Is paved the road to salvation.\\
Tesseract, within whose complex folds\\
Lies the path between worlds.
\end{flushright}

\begin{center}
Gaze upon them both,\\
Gaze with mortal eye\\
Upon immortal truth.\\
One is not so different from the other.
\end{center}

Christus, Hypercubus,\\
\hspace{3em}Hypercube of Christ.\\
A piece of heaven\\
\hspace{3em}Come to earth.

\end{verse}
