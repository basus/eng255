# Dear John

Dear John,

You're an idiot.

Yes, I know I've told you before

But don't worry, I won't tell you again.

Like you said to the blonde, the brunette,

The pink, the rainbow.

"Sorry babe, it's just not working."

Three dozen strikes, you're out.

And take your ducks with you,

Two of them are still in the bathtub.

  

Dear John,

Thanks for the pancakes.

But you know what?

I don't even like pancakes.

There, I said it. Call me a jerk,

Just don't go cry about it.

Like you cried when you were drunk

And the pink walked out,

Even though you told her to go.



Dear John,

Eddie warned me.

Of course I didn't believe him.

He's not exactly the sharpest pencil in the box.

But congratulations to you,

For proving him right.



Dear John,

I don't know anything about love,

And yet ...

Awww screw it, you're not a girl!

Though if you were,

It wouldn't have worked either.

Sorry John,

This is it!

Like they say in the movies --

In the end there can be only one!

No, there was no point to me saying that.

As I was saying,

You're an idiot!

And I'm gone.
