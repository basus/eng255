\begin{verse}
Shape of the Fourth Dimension\\
Descended to the Third.\\
Son of a Higher Plane,\\
Born on a Lower.

God is inconceivable, intractable,\\
God is beyond the Mind of Man.\\
God was born in human form,\\
Died because of human hate.

The Hypercube, unimaginable, unpaintable,\\
Only symbols give it shape.\\
Though unraveled in three dimensions,\\
It becomes a mere pale shadow \\
Of the glory in four.

Christ Jesus, with whose flesh and blood\\
Is paved the road to salvation.\\
Tesseract, within whose complex folds\\
Lies the path between worlds.

Look at them,\\
Look at them with your mortal eyes\\
Look at immortal truths.\\
One is not so different from the other.

Christus, Hypercubus,\\
Hypercube of Christ.\\
A piece of heaven\\
Fallen to earth.
\end{verse}
