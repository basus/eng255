\begin{verse}
Shape of the Fourth Dimension\\
Descended to the Third.\\
Son of a Higher Plane,\\
Born on a Lower.

God, inconceivable, intractable,\\
Beyond the Mind of Man.\\
Born in human form,\\
Died because of human hate.

Hypercube, unimaginable, unpaintable,\\
Only in symbols given shape.\\
Unraveled in three dimensions,\\
A mere shadow of the glory in four.

Christ Jesus, with whose flesh and blood\\
Is paved the road to salvation.\\
Tesseract, within whose complex folds\\
Lies the path between worlds.

Gaze upon them both,\\
Gaze with mortal eye\\
Upon immortal truth.\\
One is not so different from the other.

Christus, Hypercubus,\\
Hypercube of Christ.\\
A piece of heaven\\
Come to earth.
\end{verse}
