## Memoir

 My life is an open book,

 Each page is a memory,

 Every line a thought.


 There are the times I fell off a bike
 
 And skinned my knees.

 The times I came home after a long vacation

 To the strange smell of a familiar space.


 I have walked on grass and slipped on ice.

 I left school, friends and family, just to start over.

 I've walked down Dublin's streets, when I should have been asleep

 And I've been asleep in Paris when I should have been awake.


 I've traveled across the world

 More times than I care to count.

 For each flight, my flapping wings turn a new page.

 My life is an open book, mostly unwritten.

 I make a line for every hour,

 A dot for every minute.

 Long live pen on paper, scratch on stone.

 Longer than blood and mortal bone
