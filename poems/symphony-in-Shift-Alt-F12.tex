\begin{verse}
Keyboard, keyboard on the desk,\\ 
Where is the easiest key press?\\ 
Soft fingertip on keys' top,\\ 
Each strike a letter drops.\\ 
Humble keyboard, plastic and metal\\ 
To pen and paper quite fatal.\\ 
To the rhyme of clickety-clack\\ 
I dedicate this tuneless track.

From Big Blue's corporate culture\\ 
Sprang a noisy creature.\\ 
Buckling spring requiring strong push\\ 
IBM Model M makes the blood rush.\\ 
Each key rings as metal crumples\\ 
To some unbearable, but for others\\ 
An oath swearable.\\ 
Against RSI's rampage,\\ 
This keyboard offers safe passage. 
 
Sweet Apple's flesh,\\ 
Rosy red and fresh.\\ 
Sleek and slender, spick and span\\ 
A religion for the elegant man.\\ 
No loud clack in Steve's domain,\\ 
Soft press is each key's refrain.\\ 
First plastic and glass,\\ 
Now through metal rubber passes.\\ 
Flat and flush,\\ 
To make a diva blush.\\ 
Apple's keyboard, wired and without\\ 
Losing one makes a Sad Mac pout. 
 
Optimus Prime, leader of the Autobots.\\ 
Optimus Maximus, a keyboard made after too many pots.\\ 
Each key shines bright\\ 
With LED's organic light.\\ 
At eighty score and more a pop,\\ 
Your fingers on keys consciously drop.\\ 
Keep coffee and Coke beyond the rise,\\ 
Or sparks and smoke mark this board's demise. 
 
Dell.\\ 
Simple like a church bell.\\ 
No fancy lights,\\ 
No sharp metallic bites.\\ 
Words a dime a dozen\\ 
The price makes a college students heart lighten.\\ 
White on sable,\\ 
This one has its own fable.\\ 
With this I'll write my tome. 
 
Keyboard, keyboard on the desk,\\ 
Who's the fastest typist of them all?\\ 
At half a word a moment, it's not my call.\\ 
As the clicks fade and my symphony ends,\\ 

From quill sprung Shakespeare,\\ 
From typewriter, Twain.\\ 
Coffee table's napkin is Rowling's screen\\ 
Keyboard's bard is yet to be seen.\\ 

A hundred and four keys to press,\\ 
Humble keyboard, be stage and fence\\ 
To my finger's dance.\\ 
To the rhyme of clickety-clack\\ 
I dedicate this tuneless track.
