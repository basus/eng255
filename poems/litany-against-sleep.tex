\begin{verse}

Soft satin's welcome,\\
Warm comforter's embrace.\\
Drawing you in, relaxing, making you tired\\
Even if you weren't to begin with.\\
Sweet sleep's gentle hold upon your brain,\\
Dreamland's call, seductive, hard to ignore.\\
You close your eyes, you close your mind.\\
You sleep, hoping sometime to rise, never sure.\\

Sleep, dream, hibernate, die.\\
See the world through closed lids,\\
Spend eternity in the blink of an eye.\\
Sleep is the default,\\
Eight hours society's mandate.\\

The alarm rings.\\
You turn, an arm shoots out,\\
Reflex, little conscious thought.\\
Snooze. A few minutes more.\\

The alarm rings.\\
For the fifth time.\\
Time has past, lost to sleep,\\
Never to be reclaimed.\\
There's the moment you wake or refuse\\
to ever sleep again.\\

Sleep is a choice.\\
Slumber a decision.\\
Make the choice, embrace the responsibility.\\
No sleep without reason.\\
No stopping without cause.\\
Live through life, live beyond death.\\
Wake through the day, wake for the night.\\

I must not sleep.\\
Sleep is the mind-killer.\\
Sleep is the little-death that brings total oblivion.\\

I awaken with a purpose.\\
I sleep, but only to rise.\\
So much to do so little time.\\
Eight hours of sleep,\\
Twenty years at sixty.\\
Too much time lost,\\
Too many opportunities missed.\\
There's the moment you wake\\
And refuse ever to ever sleep again.\\
